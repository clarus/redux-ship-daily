# Redux Ship Daily
> [Redux Ship](https://github.com/clarus/redux-ship) fork of [Elm fork](https://github.com/kalutheo/elm-daily-ui) of [React Daily UI](http://www.jackoliver.info/react-daily-ui/).

We implement some React examples given in [React Daily UI](http://www.jackoliver.info/react-daily-ui/) using the [Redux Ship](https://github.com/clarus/redux-ship) library. These examples are small, sometimes without side-effects, but they are a fun playground to test Redux Ship. The idea of using these examples is taken from the [Elm Daily UI](http://www.jackoliver.info/react-daily-ui/). To inspect these examples, you can use the [redux-ship-devtools](https://github.com/clarus/redux-ship-devtools).
